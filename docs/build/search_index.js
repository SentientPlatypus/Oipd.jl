This gives us a table of strike prices along with the last or mid price each option sold for.\nPut-Call Parity Preprocessing: Apply put-call parity to create synthetic call prices from out-of-the-money put prices, reducing noise from illiquid in-the-money quotes.\nOTM Filtering: Restrict to out-of-the-money options only, keeping calls with strike prices above the current spot price and using synthetic calls constructed from OTM puts via parity.\n(Image: Paritized Options Data)\nImplied Volatility Calculation: Using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, convert option prices into implied volatilities (IV). IVs are solved using Newton's method with analytical derivatives.\n(Image: Implied Volatility Smile)\nGaussian Smoothing: Apply Gaussian kernel smoothing to the implied volatilities to reduce noise and outliers before surface fitting.\n(Image: Smoothed IV Smile) (Image: Filtered Smoothed IV Smile)\nVolatility Surface Fitting: Fit the smoothed implied-volatility smile using the SVI (Stochastic Volatility Inspired) model. During optimization, constrain the raw parameters (b geq 0, rho leq rho_textbound  1, sigma geq sigma_textmin) and enforce the Gatheral-Jacquier minimum-variance condition a + bsigmasqrt1-rho^2 geq 0. After calibration, evaluate the butterfly diagnostic g(k) on an extended log-moneyness grid; if min g  0 a CalculationError is raised.\n(Image: SVI Fitted IV Smile)\nPrice Curve Generation: From the fitted volatility smile, use the Black-Scholes-Merton model to generate a continuous curve of option prices along the full range of strike prices.\n(Image: Repriced Option Prices)\nPDF Extraction: From the continuous price curve, use numerical differentiation to compute the second derivative of call prices with respect to strike. The second derivative multiplied by the discount factor e^rtau gives the risk-neutral probability density function (Breeden-Litzenberger formula).\n(Image: Risk-Neutral PDF)\nCDF Calculation: Once we have the PDF, calculate the cumulative distribution function through numerical integration.","category":"section"},{"location":"technical/#Mathematical-Framework","page":"Technical Documentation","title":"Mathematical Framework","text":"For more details, my handwritten notes can be seen in the /notes folder.\n\nImplied Probability\nBlack Scholes","category":"section"},{"location":"technical/#Black-Scholes-Model","page":"Technical Documentation","title":"Black-Scholes Model","text":"The package implements the classic Black-Scholes model for European options:","category":"section"}]
